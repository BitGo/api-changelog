      An internal limit placed on transfers out of a wallet.  Circuit breakers can
      be defined at 3 levels:

      * Global
      * Enterprise
      * Wallet

      A lower-level circuit breaker overrides all higher-level circuit breakers.
      Global circuit breakers apply by default.  An enterprise circuit breaker
      overrides all global circuit breakers.  A wallet circuit breaker overrides
      all enterprise and global circuit breakers.

      A Wallet Event models any and all types of state-changes that pertain
      to a single wallet.

      Such events tie into the Data Team's proposed Event-Driven Architecture.

      By modeling state-changes in our services as events, it affords us the ability
      to bill users for all state-changes. This ensures that our billing service will
      scale to support new types of products.
  - name: Wallet share
    description: |
      Sharing a wallet involves giving another user permission to use the wallet.

      In order for the receiver to use the wallet, we also need to share the
      private key with them. Each user on BitGo creates
      a public-private keypair for this purpose during their signup process.

      The BitGo SDK does the following client-side to create a new wallet share:

      * Get the receiving user’s sharing key (a derived path of the receiver’s public key)
      * Decrypt the wallet to be shared locally
      * Re-encrypt the wallet against the public key above, so that only the receiver may decrypt it
      * Upload the encrypted keys to the BitGo service, which informs the receiver they have a pending share
  - name: Webhook
    description: |
      Webhooks may be setup to programmatically receive callbacks from BitGo. These may be attached to wallets (in the case of transfers), or to a block (for block notifications). Webhook notifications are triggered when the specified event occurs, such as an incoming transaction.

      BitGo servers will make a POST http request to the URL defined with a JSON payload, and expect a HTTP 200 OK. If a successful response is not received, BitGo will attempt to retry the webhook with an increasing delay between each retry.

      Since anyone on the Internet can send HTTP requests to the Webhook URL, the request body payload should not be trusted. Please verify any information sent in the webhook by fetching the transfer/block data from BitGo before processing the notification.

      Developers should take care to ensure that their application succeeds even in the cases of transient network error, or if receive the same webhook twice due to an improper acknowledgement.

      ## Rate-Limiting
      All REST endpoints are rate-limited to 10 requests/second. Once the limit is reached, requests will be rejected with `429 Too Many Requests`

      The following headers are returned on every request <table> <tr> <td>Header</td><td>Description</td> </tr> <tr> <td>X-Ratelimit-Limit</td><td>Request limit per second</td> </tr> <tr> <td>X-Ratelimit-Remaining</td><td>Remaining number of requests allowed in interval</td> </tr> <tr> <td>X-Ratelimit-Reset</td><td>Duration in milliseconds until the total quota resets</td> </tr> </table>
      The following header is also returned if the response is `429 Too Many Requests` <table> <tr> <td>Header</td><td>Description</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Retry-After</td><td>Duration in seconds of how long to wait before making a new request</td> </tr> </table>

      summary: Add wallet webhook
      description: |-
        Add a webhook to a wallet that sends an HTTP callback from BitGo to a specified
        URL when specific conditions occur. A wallet can have up to 10 webhooks of each
        wallet-webhook `type`. Learn more about webhooks on the
        [Developer Portal](/docs/webhooks-overview#/).

        **Note:** Before you process webhook notifications, BitGo strongly recommends that
        you verify response details by fetching the transfer or block data from BitGo. For
        example, if you create a transfer webhook and you receive a transfer ID, pass that
        ID to the [Get Transfer](/reference/v2walletgettransfer#/) endpoint to verify the transfer
        details.

        Updates the state of a pending approval to `approved` or `rejected`.
        You can manage pending approvals programmatically by API or with the
        BigGo web UI. Ensure your authentication token has the proper scope.
        When creating an access token in the web UI, check the permission,
        "Update Pending Approvals" (under "Account Settings" &gt; "Developer
        Options" &gt; "Access Tokens").

        BitGo recommends that you create a webhook policy so that you can
        automate approving and rejecting transactions.

      description: Create an access token to use BitGo APIs. BitGo restricts access tokens in the production environment to specific IP addresses. However, access tokens in the test environment don't require an IP address restriction. If you omit a spending limit, you must unlock the token using the [Unlock session](/reference/userunlock#/) endpoint on a regular basis to permit operations such as withdrawals. Therefore, BitGo recommends including a spending limit.

        Retrieves the private key from KMS using the provided public key, then signs and broadcasts the transaction.

        Use this endpoint only with advanced wallets. For other wallet types, use [Consolidate unspents (simple)](https://developers.bitgo.com/reference/expresswalletconsolidateunspents).

      description: |-
        Recover assets from an advanced wallet with a balance in multiple receive addresses. Build, sign, and send a consolidation and recovery, all in one call. Sign using your user and backup keys. Works for both multisignature and MPC recoveries.

        Retrieves the private keys from KMS using the provided public keys or common keychain, then signs and returns the broadcastable transaction hex.

        Note: This endpoint only works when AWM and MBE are running in recovery mode.

        To recover assets from an advanced wallet with a balance only in the base address, use [Advanced Wallets - Recover Assets](https://developers.bitgo.com/reference/advancedwalletrecovery).

        Use this endpoint only with advanced wallets. For other wallet types, use the [Wallet Recovery Wizard](https://developers.bitgo.com/docs/wallets-recover#/).

        - Occurs when the request parameters are invalid or malformed.
        - Examples: Invalid UUID format for connectionId, invalid enterpriseId format,
        malformed request body, invalid signature format.

        - 401: Authentication Error
        - Occurs when the request is not authorized.
        - Examples: Caller is not a member of the enterprise.

        - 403: Permission Denied Error
        - Occurs when the authenticated client doesn't have necessary permissions.
        - Examples: Enterprise does not have OES license.

        - 404: Not Found Error
        - Occurs when the specified connection cannot be found.
        - Examples: Connection ID doesn't exist, connection doesn't belong to this client.

        - 422: Deallocation Error with Released Status
        - Occurs when the deallocation cannot be processed due to business rules.
        - Examples: Insufficient funds available for deallocation, connection is inactive,
        deallocation amount exceeds available balance.

        - 500: Internal Server Error or Reserved Deallocation
        - Occurs when there's an unexpected server error processing the request.

        This API call allows partners to inform the OES system about an update to an allocation made to one of 
        their connections. This endpoint is only relevant to OES partners that have async allocations enabled.

        A successful response indicates that the allocation was successfully updated in the OES system and the funds 
        are cleared (if cleared is passed for status) or released (if released is passed for status).

      summary: Perform Partner Settlement
      description: |-
        Partner route to perform a settlement. This endpoint allows partners without disputes enabled to create
        new settlements between client accounts, transferring funds according to the specified amounts.

        Please note that this endpoint cannot be used by partners with disputes enabled, instead use the
        V2 Settlement endpoint. This is because dispute enabled partners must have an asyncronous settlement
        process to allow clients time to review the settlement and reconcile liabilities agains their trading
        activity on your platform. In the event that you cal this endpoint and you have disputes enabled, you
        will recieve a 403 response.

        Error scenarios:
        - 400: Invalid Request Error
        - Occurs when the request parameters are invalid or malformed.
        - Examples: Invalid format for settlement amounts, missing required fields,
        invalid signature.

        - 401: Authentication Error or Incomplete Settlement
        - Occurs when the request is not authorized or cannot be completed immediately.
        - Examples: Caller is not a member of the enterprise, signature verification failed.

        - 403: Permission Denied Error
        - Occurs when the authenticated partner doesn't have necessary permissions.
        - Examples: Enterprise does not have OES license, partner is enabled for disputes, partner is inactive.

        - 409: Conflict Error
        - Occurs when the request conflicts with current state.
        - Examples: Settlement already exists with the same externalId and different properties.

        - 500: Internal Server Error or Incomplete Settlement
        - Occurs when there's an unexpected server error processing the request.
        - Examples: Database connection issues, settlement initiated but not completed due to transient errors.

                     - Structured as a Record<ConnectionId, Record<Currency, Amount>>.
                       - Amount is either base units integer string or full units decimal string depending on
                       partners configuration.  
                       - (+ amount for connection gain, - amount for connection loss)
                     - Can be used by broker partners or exchange partners, 
                     however for broker partners the amounts for each currency must net to 0 (spread not yet supported).
                    - Connection to connection liabilities
                     - Expresses amounts each connection owes to one another.

                       - (+ amount for connection gain, - amount for connection loss)

        Used by dispute enabled exchange partners to stage a settlement for connected clients.

        This endpoint will:
        1. Authenticate the request by verifying the payload and signature provided.
        2. Create entities:
        a. Create the settlement entity
        b. Map provided settlement amounts to settlement transfer records for execution.
        3. Assign closed, unassigned disputes from prior settlements to this settlement
        a. Pull in any adjustedSettlementTransfers from said disputes.
        b. Update the settledInSettlementId on said disputes.
        4. Verify the relevant connection balances against liabilities based on provided settlementAmounts
        and assigned settlement transfers from disputes being assigned.
        5. Notify connection owners of a new settlement.
        6. Queue an event to finalize the settlement once the dispute window ends.

        This endpoint is idempotent and can safely be called again with the same exact request body
        without worrying about creating multiple settlements.

        Please note that provided settlement amounts should be based solely on new trading activity
        that was not included in the last settlement. Instructions from closed, unsettled disputes should
        not be included in the calculation of settlement instructions on the
        Settlement will be processed asynchronously once initiated, after dispute / top up window have elapsed.

        specify keys. The recommended (and simpler) method is [Generate Wallet](/reference/expresswalletgenerate)
        with the SDK or BitGo Express. You can also create wallets in the BitGo UI.

        This API creates a new wallet for the user or enterprise. The keys to
        use with the new wallet (passed in the 'keys' parameter) must be
        registered with BitGo prior to using this API.

        BitGo currently only supports 2-of-3 (e.g., m=2 and n=3) wallets. The
        third key, and only the third key, must be a BitGo key. The first key
        is by convention the user key, with its encrypted xprv stored on BitGo.

        Ethereum and XRP wallets can only be created under an enterprise. Pass in the
        id of the enterprise to associate the wallet with. Your enterprise id
        can be seen by clicking on the "Manage Organization" link in the
        enterprise dropdown. Using the Add Wallet API, you can create a wallet
        using either the enterprise fee address (used by default for all
        wallets in the enterprise), or a unique fee address (created manually
        with the Keychains API). Pass the desired key as the third key ID in
        the 'keys' array. In either case, the fee address must be funded
        before creating the wallet.

        You cannot generate a wallet by passing in a subtoken (i.e. ERC20 token) as the coin.
        Subtokens use the wallet of their parent coin and it is not possible to create a
        wallet specific to one token. For example, to create a wallet for an ERC20 token,
        create an Ethereum wallet. It can hold any ERC20 tokens as well as Ether.

        BitGo Ethereum wallet is a smart-contract implementing multi-signature scheme.
        Because contracts itself can not initiate transactions, fee addresses are used
        for this purpose. Ethereum transactions initiated by a given address, are
        confirmed by the network in order of creation, so one lower fee transaction can
        potentially delay all subsequent transactions. To help lower network fee costs,
        two fee addresses are provided.

        `feeAddress` is a main fee address usable for all operations.
        `lowPriorityFeeAddress` is a secondary fee address that can be used to pay
        lower fee for Create Address operations without risking delaying subsequent
        higher-priority transactions initiated by main fee address.

        Local client-side function to create a new keychain.

        Creating your keychains is a critical step for safely securing your Bitcoin. When generating new keychains, this API uses a random number generator that adheres to industry standards. If you provide your own seed, you must take extreme caution when creating it.
        Returns an object containing the xprv and xpub for the new chain. The created keychain is not known to the BitGo service. To use it with the BitGo service, use the ‘Store Keychain’ API call.

        For security reasons, it is highly recommended that you encrypt and destroy the original xprv immediately to prevent theft.

        Generate a new wallet for a coin. If you want a wallet to hold tokens, generate a wallet for the native coin of the blockchain (e.g. generate an ETH wallet to hold ERC20 tokens).

        Calling this endpoint does all of the following:

        * Creates the user keychain locally on your machine and encrypts it with the provided passphrase (skipped if you pass a `userKey`).
        * Creates the backup keychain locally on your machine.
        * Uploads the encrypted user keychain and public backup keychain to BitGo.
        * Creates the BitGo key (and the backup key if you pass `backupXpubProvider`) on the service.
        * Creates the wallet on BitGo with the 3 public keys above.

        ⓘ Many account-based assets, including Ethereum, require you to [Fund Gas Tanks](https://developers.bitgo.com/docs/get-started-gas-tanks) to initialize new wallets on chain. Ensure your gas tank has a sufficient balance to cover this cost before generating a new wallet.

      description: |
        This endpoint verifies whether a given address belongs to the specified wallet.
        It performs cryptographic verification, checking address derivation against wallet keychains and configuration.

        Returns `true` if the address belongs to the wallet.
        Throws an error if verification fails or parameters are invalid.

        To verify a baseAddress, set `baseAddress` and `address` to the base address of the wallet.

        Due to architecture limitations, forwarder version 0 addresses cannot be verified and will return `true` without verification.

        Verifying custodial wallet addresses is not supported.

      summary: Accelerate Transaction
      operationId: express.wallet.acceleratetx
      description: |
        Send a new transaction to accelerate the targeted unconfirmed transaction either by using Child-Pays-For-Parent (CPFP) or Replace-By-Fee (RBF).

        **Background**:
        1. In Bitcoin, a transaction can only be included in a block when all its inputs are confirmed.
        This requirement can be used to increase the effective fee rate of a stuck low-fee transaction.
        One of the stuck transaction's outputs is spent in a child transaction with a much higher fee.
        Miners include the transactions with the highest fees first to maximize their revenue,
        but the high-fee child transaction can only be included once the parent transaction is confirmed.
        The miners are therefore incentivized to include both the parent and the child transaction together in a block.
        A Child-Pays-For-Parent transaction can be created by a recipient of the transaction or by the sender if the
        target transaction has a change output.
        2. In Bitcoin, a transaction can be replaced by a new transaction with a higher fee as long as the new transaction spends few or all of the same inputs used by the original transaction that's being replaced. Unlike CPFP, only the sender of the transaction can create a Replace-By-Fee transaction, and only either of the transactions can be confirmed. More often than not, the replacement transaction with the higher fee will be accepted by the miners.

        **Notes**:
        1. As other coins do not have a blockspace market, this route is only available for Bitcoin at this time.<br/>
        2. Using CPFP, if a target transaction depends on other unconfirmed transactions, this route also adds sufficient fees to elevate the entire transaction ancestry's effective fee rate to the `cpfpFeeRate`.

      summary: Place Order
      description: |
        Places a new order. There are several types of orders available - Market, Limit, TWAP, and SteadyPace (the latter two optionally support a limit price).
        Orders can be funded by your account balance or on margin.
        - When an order with funding type "funded" is placed, funds will be reserved from your Go account for the amount of the order. You must have sufficient available balance in your Go account to place a funded order.
        - When an order with funding type "margin" is placed, funds will be reserved from your Margin Trade Account. You must have sufficient available margin (NOP limit) to place a margin order.
        See our [Trade Guide](/docs/trade-overview) for more details on each order type and funding options.

        **Note:** New Ethereum addresses require blockchain confirmation before you can consolidate from them.

To reduce the cost of creating ETH forwarders, BitGo uses a set  of forwarder contracts that deploy as a simple proxy to a single  implementation (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1167).  Additionally, forwarders deploy using opcode, CREATE2, enabling  them to deploy only when needed (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1014).  These forwarders otherwise operate identically to prior ETH forwarders. Use this flag to specify the forwarder contract version when  deploying a forwarder contract. Use 0 for the older forwarder  (https://github.com/BitGo/eth-multisig-v2). Use 1 for the new fee-improved  forwarder (https://github.com/BitGo/eth-multisig-v4). Use 2 for  NFT-supported forwarders and version 2 wallets. Use 3 for MPC wallets.  Use 4 for forwarders with the same functionality as v2 but with some changes. v4 is applicable for Arbitrum, Optimism, ZkSync, and other EVM-compatible chains that we will onboard in the future. Use 5 for new MPC based wallets with wallet-version 6

      summary: List derived wallets for an EVM keyring
      description: |-
        Lists all child wallets derived from an EVM keyring parent wallet. This endpoint accepts
        either a parent wallet ID or a child wallet ID:
        - If given a parent wallet ID (wallet with `isParent=true`), returns all child wallets
        - If given a child wallet ID (wallet with `evmKeyRingReferenceWalletId`), returns all sibling
        child wallets that share the same parent

        Child wallets are identified by having the `evmKeyRingReferenceWalletId` field set to the
        parent wallet's ID. Child wallets can be on different chains (e.g., BSC, Polygon, Arbitrum)
        but share the same key material from the parent wallet.

        Returns wallets with the same structure as the normal list wallet API, including:
        - Balance information (balance, confirmedBalance, spendableBalance)
        - Token balances for all tokens on each chain
        - Staking balances (if includeStakingBalances is set)
        - Receive addresses (unless skipReceiveAddress is set)
        - Policy information (if expandPolicy is set)
        - All other wallet properties

        - Non-keyring wallet: Returns stuck txs from that single wallet only

        The response includes both successful results and any errors encountered while querying individual wallets,

        A `sequenceId` is a unique and arbitrary wallet identifier applied to transfers and transactions at creation. It is optional but highly recommended. With a `sequenceId` you can easily reference transfers and transactions&mdash;for example, to safely retry sending. Because the system only confirms one send request per `sequenceId` (and fails all subsequent attempts), you can retry sending without the risk of double spending. The `sequenceId` is only visible to users on the wallet and is not shared publicly.

            A `sequenceId` is a unique and arbitrary wallet identifier applied to transfers and transactions at creation. It is optional but highly recommended. With a `sequenceId` you can easily reference transfers and transactions&mdash;for example, to safely retry sending. Because BitGo only confirms one send request per `sequenceId` (and fails all subsequent attempts), you can retry sending without the risk of double spending. The `sequenceId` is only visible to users on the wallet and is not shared publicly. It is the responsibility of the caller to keep track of this ID.
          example: abc123

        targetWalletUnspents:
          type: integer
          description: |
            Specifies the minimum count of good-sized unspents to maintain in the wallet. Change splitting ceases when the
            wallet has `targetWalletUnspents` good-sized unspents.

            **Note**: Wallets that continuously send a high count of transactions will automatically split large change amounts
            into multiple good-sized change outputs while they have fewer than `targetWalletUnspents` good-sized unspents in
            their unspent pool. Breaking up large unspents helps to reduce the amount of unconfirmed funds in flight in future
            transactions, and helps to avoid long chains of unconfirmed transactions. This is especially useful for newly
            funded wallets or recently refilled send-only wallets.

        sequenceId:

          description: |
            A `sequenceId` is a unique and arbitrary wallet identifier applied to transfers and transactions at creation. It is optional but highly recommended. With a `sequenceId` you can easily reference transfers and transactions&mdash;for example, to safely retry sending. Because the system only confirms one send request per `sequenceId` (and fails all subsequent attempts), you can retry sending without the risk of double spending. The `sequenceId` is only visible to users on the wallet and is not shared publicly.

        Used for broker-style settlements, where the source and destination are both client-owned 
        connections. This structure allows specifying multiple source connections, each with multiple
        destination connections, and the currency amounts being settled between them.

            A seed used to create a deterministic BIP-32 path which is then used to derive a private key. This is useful when one wants to create multiple BitGo cold wallets but only protect a single master private key. Using the seed one can create a child key for a specific wallet, for instance an Ethereum wallet could use the "eth" seed while an XRP wallet could use "xrp" as a seed. Both of these child keys would be derived from a single master key and so only the master key needs to be stored and protected.

    OgStakingRequestPOSTBody:
      title: OG stake
      description: |
        Create an OG staking request to delegate tokens to a validator.

        OG uses a share-based delegation model:
        1. You send tokens to the validator contract
        2. The validator issues shares representing your proportional ownership
        3. Shares are stored in the delegation's properties
        4. Share value increases as validator earns rewards (auto-compounding)

        Transaction Details:
        - Function: delegate(address delegatorAddress) payable
        - Tokens sent as msg.value
        - Shares calculated by validator: (tokensDeposited * totalShares) / totalTokens
        - No warmup period: delegation active immediately after confirmation
      allOf:
        - $ref: '#/components/schemas/StakingRequestPOSTBody'
        - type: object
          properties:
            validator:
              type: string
              description: |
                OG validator contract address in EVM format (0x...).

                This is the validator's smart contract that manages delegations,
                not the validator's operator address. You can get a list of
                active validators from the /validators endpoint.
              pattern: ^0x[a-fA-F0-9]{40}$
              example: '0x08fC637A7802C1210Cc071c2dc65bcad26bAdBDf'

    OgUnStakingRequestPOSTBody:
      title: OG unstake
      description: |
        Create an OG unstaking request to withdraw tokens from a validator.

        IMPORTANT: OG unstaking is share-based, but you specify token amounts.
        The service calculates shares automatically:

        Process:
        1. You specify the token amount to unstake (e.g., 50 OG)
        2. Service calculates proportional shares: (yourShares * amount) / yourDelegated
        3. Service fetches dynamic withdrawal fee from validator contract
        4. Transaction burns your shares and initiates withdrawal
        5. 2-day cooldown period begins
        6. After cooldown, tokens credited to your wallet

        Transaction Details:
        - Function: undelegate(address withdrawalAddress, uint256 shares) payable
        - Shares calculated proportionally from amount
        - Withdrawal fee sent as msg.value (fetched from validator)
        - Cooldown: 2 days (172800 seconds)

        Share Calculation Example:
          Your delegation: 100 OG, 100 shares
          Unstake amount: 30 OG
          Shares burned: (100 * 30) / 100 = 30 shares

        Note: Actual tokens received may differ slightly from requested amount
        due to exchange rate changes during transaction confirmation.

      description: |
        Request to switch staking delegation from one validator to another for SeiEVM.
        Supports both full and partial redelegation.

        **Partial Redelegation:** You can redelegate a specific amount from the source validator.
        - Specify the exact amount to redelegate in wei (18 decimals)
        - If partially redelegating, must leave at least the minimum stake amount (1 SEI = 1000000000000000000 wei) in the source delegation
        - If the remaining amount would be less than minimum stake, must redelegate the full amount
        - Source delegation remains active with the remaining balance after partial redelegation
        - Example: To redelegate 10 SEI from a 50 SEI delegation, use amount '10000000000000000000' (leaves 40 SEI in source)

        **Redelegation Constraints:** SeiEVM enforces protocol-level redelegation limits:
        - Maximum 7 redelegations between the same validator pair within 21 days
        - 21-day lock period on the destination validator after redelegation (cannot redelegate FROM the destination validator for 21 days)
        - These constraints are enforced by the blockchain protocol and cannot be bypassed

        **Auto-Claim Feature:** During validator switching, any pending rewards from the source validator
        may be automatically claimed and included in the transaction. This auto-claim behavior is handled
        transparently and will be reflected in the transaction events and delegation reward tracking.

        amount:
          type: string

            Amount to redelegate in wei (18 decimals).

            For partial redelegation:
            - Specify the amount to move from source to destination validator
            - Must leave at least 1 SEI (1000000000000000000 wei) in the source delegation
            - Source delegation remains active with the remaining balance

            For full redelegation:
            - Specify the entire delegated amount
            - Source delegation becomes inactive after completion

            The amount must be between the minimum stake (1 SEI) and the maximum switchable amount
            (available balance minus pending unstake, as shown in wallet attributes).

            Examples:
            - Partial: '10000000000000000000' (10 SEI from 50 SEI delegation, leaves 40 SEI)
            - Full: '50000000000000000000' (50 SEI, entire delegation amount)
          example: '10000000000000000000'

        Request to unstake SEIEVM tokens.

        **Auto-Claim Feature:** During unstaking, any pending rewards may be automatically claimed
        and included in the final transaction. This auto-claim behavior is handled transparently
        and will be reflected in the transaction events and delegation reward tracking.

        **Unbonding Period:** After the unstake transaction completes, tokens enter a 21-day
        unbonding period before they become available in your wallet. During this period, the
        tokens are locked and cannot be used for staking or transfers.

        **Decimal Units:** Amount must be specified in micro units (6 decimals).
        Example: 1 SEI = 1,000,000 micro. To unstake 10 SEI, use amount '10000000'.

        Request to claim staking rewards for Somi.

        **Key Features:**
        - Requires explicit delegation ID to specify which delegation to claim rewards from
        - Validates claim amount against actual claimable rewards on blockchain
        - Auto-claim detection: Rewards may be automatically claimed during undelegate transactions
        - Amount synchronization: The requested amount is adjusted to match actual claimable amount
        - Follows standard claim rewards pattern consistent with other blockchain services

        **Note:** The delegationId parameter is required to identify the specific delegation to claim rewards from.

        **Auto-Claim Feature:** During unstaking, any pending rewards may be automatically claimed 
        and included in the final transaction. This auto-claim behavior is handled transparently 
        and will be reflected in the transaction events and delegation reward tracking.

        - FLEXIBLE (default): No lock-up period, 14-day cooldown on unstake
        - SHORT: 90 days lock-up
        - MEDIUM: 360 days lock-up

            A `sequenceId` is a unique and arbitrary wallet identifier applied to transfers and transactions at creation. It is optional but highly recommended. With a `sequenceId` you can easily reference transfers and transactions&mdash;for example, to safely retry sending. Because the system only confirms one send request per `sequenceId` (and fails all subsequent attempts), you can retry sending without the risk of double spending. The `sequenceId` is only visible to users on the wallet and is not shared publicly.

You must retry the transaction. - `initialized`: The initial state when creating a transfer. - `pendingApproval`: The transfer requires admin approval to proceed. - `rejected`: The transfer was rejected by an admin. - `removed`: A network re-org occurred, causing the confirmed transfer to be removed from the blockchain. - `replaced`: The transfer was stuck due to having a low fee and was replaced by a new transfer with a higher fee. - `reversed`: The transfer was reversed (e.g., when a withdrawal offer is rejected in multi-step transfers). - `signed`: The transfer was approved by an admin (if required) and then signed by BitGo. - `unconfirmed`: The signed transaction was sent to the network, and is pending on-chain validation.'

"cold" wallets are wallets where the private key of the user key is stored exclusively outside of BitGo's system. "custodial" means that this wallet is a cold wallet where BitGo owns the keys. Only customers of the BitGo Trust can create this kind of wallet. "custodialPaired" means that this is a hot wallet that is owned by the customer but it will be linked to a cold (custodial) wallet where BitGo owns the keys.

            A `sequenceId` is a unique and arbitrary wallet identifier applied to transfers and transactions at creation. It is optional but highly recommended. With a `sequenceId` you can easily reference transfers and transactions&mdash;for example, to safely retry sending. Because BitGo only confirms one send request per `sequenceId` (and fails all subsequent attempts), you can retry sending without the risk of double spending. The `sequenceId` is only visible to users on the wallet and is not shared publicly. It is the responsibility of the caller to keep track of this ID.
